## 💭 Reflection  

Answer briefly (1–2 paragraphs):

- What was your testing approach?  We used Dynamic testing as we interacted with the code and we did not look at the code from top to bottom.
- What did you find easy or difficult during the task?  
1.When determinig the input case It was difficult to know if the issue was spelling or application issue
2.To determine why some cities were not working yet they are real cities.
3.To determine the accurancy of the Weather App.

- How confident are you now in identifying and reporting bugs?
I am still learning and hope to get better as time goes by.
